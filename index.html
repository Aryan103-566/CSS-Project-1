 <h1> <span id="Heading" >iPhone 15</span> 's shift to USB-C</h1>

 <p>
    <span id="Para">Apple</span> is set to reveal the iPhone 15 at a special event held tomorrow, Tuesday September 12,
    and we already know a lot about what to expect thanks to rumors and supply chain sources
    â€” but this time thanks also to European Union regulators. That last source strongly suggests
    that the newest iPhone will get a USB-C connector, replacing the Lightning connector
    that Apple introduced with the iPhone 5 in 2012.
 </p>  
 <p>
    That's <span id="Para2">not all we expect to see in a new iPhone</span>, but it could be the most significant shift
    because of what it potentially unlocks. That's particularly true for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max,
    which are both expected to get a Thunderbolt port that makes use of the same connector as USB-C,
    but adds a whole lot of additional capabilities in terms of input and output options, for data,
    display, power and more.
